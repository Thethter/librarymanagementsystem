				<h2>Welcome to The Librariea</h2>
				<b>The standard chunk of library</b>
				<p>
					Library is a room where the books on different subjects are kept. Everyone should read books including the students because only text books cannot provide us with knowledge. Those who cannot buy the books must read them from the library. Students should â€˜take the books from school library and read it. I am a student of class fifth. My school has a very big library. It has books on various subjects and they are arranged in the almirahs class wise. There are chairs and tables in the library. A library has certain rules which we are supposed to follow. We should remain quiet in the library. The books are issued for just a week and then it is given back to the librarian in proper condition.A library is very useful to us. We should read books. Reading books is a very good hobby. Books are our best friends. They help us a lot by giving knowledge.
